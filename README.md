# meeting-scheduler
This is a full stack application I developed using Spring Boot for backend and Angular for front-end. The application implements a JWT authentication for security and a relational database (in my case, I used mysql) for database. 

Here's basically how the application works. You go to the register page and create an account. You can then go to the login page to enter
the credentials you just registered with. 

You can create a new meeting, invite other registered users to a meeting, accept or reject a meeting invitation, see a list of past and future meetings. You can also click on a meeting to see the stats for a meeting like no. of attendees, no. of accepts, no. of rejects, etc. 

The app has a fairly responsive design and is by no means, ugly.
